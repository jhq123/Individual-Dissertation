A model based on the combination of ARIMA and neural networks (PSONN and ANN) is investigated to forecast foreign currency exchange rates. The purpose of this research is to design a combination methodology benefiting from the strengths of both ARIMA and NN models to predict exchange rate series properly and accurately.
The models were trained from historical data of different time series. The linear part of the series set is processed through the ARIMA model, and the remaining nonlinear part is processed by ANN. The objective of the project is to predict three foreign exchange rates against USD (GBP, AUD and JPY). The performance of the model was evaluated using a set of widely accepted statistical metrics and compared with the performance of models accomplished by single methodology. With the analysis of the data, it is possible to conclude that the model designed with combination methodology gives a close prediction of exchange rates and contains better performance than models designed with single methodology.
